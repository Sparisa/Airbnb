# Airbnb Toronto Price Prediction

##Introduction

Airbnb is an online marketplace that offers lodging services, homesyaing services and tourisim activities to travelors since 2008. In this project, I have performed EDA on Toronto 
airbnb data from june 3rd 2017. Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and is a destination to so many travallors. Hence, the Airbnb is plying a significant role in the
rental markettplace of Toronto. In this kernel, I built three classification models to choose the one with the highest prediction accuracy score. Meanwhile, I will discuss feature 
importance and the expolaratory analysis that I have done.
